<strong>What is EasyMail?</strong>

EasyMail is a tool that takes user-generated text input and formats it into Amnesty’s HTML template for an Engaging Networks mass mail send. EasyMail is written in Python 3.7. 

<strong>Using EasyMail:</strong>
EasyMail cannot be accessed through a clickable icon, or run through the finder. In order to run EasyMail, you will need to use an IDE or the Terminal Interface on a Mac. Below is a quick overview of how to use the Terminal Interface to run EasyMail. 

<strong>Using the Terminal Interface – for Mac</strong>
You will need to know two commands for the Terminal, cd and ls. 

Open up the terminal and type ls (short for list). This displays the folders in the directory you are presently in.

Next, you will use cd (change directory) to navigate to the directory that EasyMail is saved in. In my case, it’s nested a few folders in, so I would type in the following commands:

<code>cd Python</code>
<code>cd EasyMail</code>

OR

<code>cd Python/EasyMail</code>

Now I am in the EasyMail directory. 

All I need to do now is type <code>python app.py</code> and hit enter. This brings up the EasyMail interface. 

Here, I can specify the details of the email, add tags by highlighting text, and generate the HTML of the email. Once that is complete, I copy paste the generated HTML into Engaging Networks. 

<strong>Needed Updates/Changes</strong> 

EasyMail is still in a beta mode, and changes will need to be made to address bugs and add functionality as more people use it.
