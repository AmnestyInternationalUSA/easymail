Dear %%SALUTATION%%,

You have played an important part in our ongoing efforts to win the release of human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh. Thank you.

Because you care so much, I want to share an important update.

%%ITALIC%%%%BOLD%%%%UNDERLINE%%UPDATE: One million signatures demanding Nasrin’s immediate and unconditional release have just been delivered to Iranian embassies.%%UNDERLINE%%%%BOLD%%%%ITALIC%%

This month, the Amnesty team delivered a million signatures to Iranian embassies around the world. Each signature, demanding Nasrin’s immediate and unconditional release, represents someone like you &mdash; someone who is outraged by her cruel sentence and is willing to demand her freedom.

%%BOLD%%With your support, we are sending Iranian authorities a clear message: the world is watching and our campaign will continue until Nasrin Sotoudeh is free!%%BOLD%%

The sheer scope of this campaign &mdash; representing over 200 countries and territories &mdash;  demonstrates that, no matter where we live, we are united by our humanity and the need to stand up against human rights violations.

Thanks for being part of our movement.
