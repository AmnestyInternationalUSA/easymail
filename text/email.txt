%%HERO%%%%SALUTATION%%, YOU CAN HELP BRING NASRIN HOME: DONATE NOW%%HERO%%

Dear %%SALUTATION%%,

%%BOLD%%We’ve brought Nasrin home once before. We must do it again. And we must do it before she receives a brutal lashing.%%BOLD%%

Nasrin Sotoudeh — a prominent human rights lawyer in Iran — is facing 148 brutal lashes and 38 years in jail… simply for defending human rights activists, including women who removed their mandatory headscarves. %%RED%%YES, YOU READ THAT RIGHT.%%RED%%

We’re putting our energy and expertise to work to immediately bring Nasrin home — and %%LINK%%we need 1,000 donors so we can expand our critical efforts demanding Nasrin’s release. Please help.%%LINK%%

%%LINK%%Be one of Amnesty’s most important donors this month — and match Nasrin’s courage with your generosity today >>%%LINK%%

Nasrin was targeted in the past — but when Amnesty supporters worked together back in 2013, we were able to secure her early release from prison. %%LINK%%%%SALUTATION%%, with your financial support, we can do it again.%%LINK%%

Nasrin has been handed down the harshest sentence recorded against a human rights defender in Iran in recent years. It’s an abhorrent injustice.

%%LINK%%Please help us bring Nasrin home — to her husband, to her two children and to her important work as a human rights lawyer.%%LINK%%
